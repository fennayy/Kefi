                        <h3>By Oojal Kaur</h3>
                        <h3>August 8, 2020</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                            Dear Stranger who wants to give up, 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Don’t. And while you may think it’s the easiest answer anyone would give you, it’s still the most honest one. Just because life didn’t end up the way you planned, does that mean you should stop living it? When you read a book, watch a film and see your favourite character in a bad mood, you always want them to be happy. You always wants your loved ones to be safe, peaceful and smiling. So why can’t you want that for yourself? Is it so difficult to want the best for your own? 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            I promise you there are better things to come. You just need to hold on a little tight, not let everything get to you and be the best version of yourself. You got out of bed today? That’s great! You had an entire meal for lunch? Treat yourself with a movie! You socialised today? Pat yourself on the back. Appreciate every little thing that you do and I promise it’ll get better. I know, because I’ve been there too. In a spot light where everything is too shiny around you but you just can’t seem to open your eyes to admire the beauty. You’re too stuck in your own mind that it’s hard to walk out. But you know what? There’s a secret door you need to find and only you have a key to it. Look for it, and you’ll be happy again. You’ll be you.

                        <p>Writing is my escape but, at the same time, it's what grounds me to reality. I swear by some cliches, like Pride and Prejudice and have daily conflicts with a mind like Ernest Hemingway.</p>
