                        <h1>SOME HABITS THAT CHANGED MY LIFE</h1>
                        <h3>By Daniel George</h3>
                        <h3>July 6, 2020</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                            Since the quarantine started, none of us have met our friends or done any outdoor activities. These used to be great vent outs for all of us. Me personally being stuck at home, I replaced all these activities with gaming the entire day or even just binge watching TV shows. I literally would wake up thinking about how to increase my rank in CSGO or set a goal of how many episodes I want to complete in one day. It got to a point where I ruined my sleep schedule by gaming all night and I would keep myself awake by making Maggi or eating so many midnight snacks. I gained so much weight by doing so and then I really didn’t care about it because I wasn’t going out anywhere to meet anybody or do any physically activity. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Obviously this lifestyle feels fun where I am not stressing out at all but after the first month I felt really lost in life with no direction and also became really fat!        
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            It really peaked when I started gaining so much weight that I became so lethargic in everything I wanted to do. I would not feel like helping my parents with anything and slowly my mental health started reaching the same state as my physical health. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            So one day I was really frustrated and done with playing CSGO all day. I decided to use this energy of grinding TV shows and games to working out. I set up a counter on my phone to count every single day I workout, avoid playing games and not indulge in junk food.  
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            My first day on climbing stairs I was so exhausted but I have never felt better in the past two months than I felt on this first day. I incremented my counter by 1 and I felt amazing. Since that day I have slowly gradually increased my workout from climbing stairs by adding runs, pushups, and dumbbell’s. It has been 56 days since I started this streak and I haven’t missed a single workout day since then. While working out I used to deal with all my anxieties and think about me climbing up in life while I was climbing the stairs!  
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Set small goals for yourself in the start and it’s really not about going all out since day 1. Make gradual improvements to your workout and your diet slowly. Make sure you enjoy this process with every improvement. Listen to music, motivate yourself with better fitness equipment and mainly enjoy this transformation process!  
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            The post workout energy has given me so much energy to do different things. I feel so good about myself when I see my counter and increment it after every single session. I started helping my parents with different household activities. I literally haven’t had a single Maggi since 56 days or any junk, and trust me I haven’t forced myself to do this.  
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            After 2 months of eating junk and feeling so negative, I literally don’t feel like eating any junk and going back to my old lifestyle.
                            After getting so exhausted on climbing stairs and struggling so much, I wouldn’t want to give that up for feeling good by eating junk.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            I also started developing new interests because I had so much time left in the entire day. See now this is the moment where you can nail it. With so much time left and also feeling good with your post workout energy you start doing things which you always wanted to do in life!
                            I started cooking different recipes, sketching and doing different courses on Udemy/Coursera. 
                            I have finished 4 courses since then and had so much fun while sketching, cooking during my free time!
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Mental fitness and physical fitness go hand in hand and it’s the first step to success!
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            See it’s not about being very productive and stressing yourself out to be productive. It’s about slowly improving and focusing on positive things you would enjoy doing. Playing games and binge watching TV shows are still great options for the same but in the long run you wouldn’t feel great about it.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Try replacing that with trying to learn new things and working out on a daily basis. Working out is a key aspect in this new lifestyle because it’s going to make you feel really good and confident about yourself!
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            I started finding time to learn things which I always wanted to learn like Adobe programs which was really fun! I literally have been procrastinating to do the same since such a long time but never got the time or energy to do so.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            It’s a great time to start applying this because we have so much time in the quarantine to do things. 
                            Start slow but be consistent about it, it’s obviously going to be tough in the starting few days, but after like 20 days it’s going to become a habit. Make working out your habit or make doing something productive your habit. 
                            The goal is not to have the most perfect ripped body or being the most skilled educated person out there. The goal is to have so much positive energy in yourself that you can apply yourself to anything if your put your mind to it!                            
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            This confident positive energy is about focusing on yourself only and creating a healthy lifestyle!
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            You don’t to have to stress yourself out by doing difficult courses in the start itself or doing difficult workouts. Start slow and keep the focus on enjoying the process which will automatically upgrade to gradually doing more! As long as you keep enjoying learning new things and getting positive post workout energy you are on the right track.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Don’t go hard on yourself but at least start. You have to choose to be happy just like Kefi says and make this choice for yourself to do so.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            It may be a bit stressful in the start but it’s going to be the best decision you can make to improve yourself in the long run!
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Be addicted to focusing on yourself and improving yourself on a daily basis by choosing to be happy!
