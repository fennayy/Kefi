                            It’s conventional to stay happy when you achieve something or things go as you planned. But, it is important to stay happy and calm, at other times as well where you see things falling apart. Of course, it’s not easy to stay happy all the times, but at least you could stay positive.

                            You go to college, work, and places in your day-to-day life in the course of fulfilling your dreams and desires. If you just slow down your speed, and look at the people around the world, you’ll get to see happiness, sadness, sadness hid behind the happy faces. But, what matters is, one should always be satisfied with what they are doing and what they have, at least for time being. You can’t rush into things to fall in place.

                            Here’s something I found, what happiness is according to a person who operates the lift in the building. From morning 9 am to 7 pm, with one hour lunch break, a man is hired for operating lift, and helping people. He always presents a smile, greets a good morning and when asked about his life, he said he was happy. And he meant it, he was happy, since he was satisfied, he could make people happy, he said, “tho I don’t earn much from my job, it lets me buy everything I need, and apart this, I help people and make them smile, because I like to see people smile, before and after a long tired day.”
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Happiness, is not an option, its a choice, a millionaire has the potential to get any thing he/she wants, but might not be happy, unless he is satisfied. And, even if you have everything, but still you don’t find yourself happy, then make others happy, this surely will make you happy. There’s nothing more relieving than to see a person smiling and being happy, because of you.
