                            I thank quarantine for making me realise one of the most important things in life, which we all know and read it everyday, everywhere......yet forget to implement it.

                        <p>
                            Our age is such that we tend to make many friends & also have a lot of acquaintance, so subconsciously we all compare our life with theirs, where ever possible. The only disadvantage of comparison (of our life with others) being till date, is either we becoming overconfident or under confident. I used to do the same, i didn’t compare everything yet i did compare a few things like marks and love life, and trust me it never did any good & i realised that i am a late bloomer in a lot of things.....which obviously didn’t make me happy.

                        <p>
                            We stand amidst rising uncertainties and a lingering question `What next?’

                            In June, our results were out and since our entire class had submitted the same write-up for the assignments (on the basis of which we were graded) , i scored comparatively low than my friends, which made me upset....but i managed to pick myself up and keep myself busy with a tv series (the office) . After a few days a close friend called me up and said that she started dating a guy , which again made me upset because my love life is nearly non existent ; then starts the roller coaster of self doubt and low self esteem......i called my bestfriend (vasu) and she talked me out of it , but again this was kind of a never ending cycle, reason being all these distractions and someone else telling me “it’s okay” is the reason that wouldn’t make me happy from inside (i can say this now because right now I am happy from inside). A few days later, i was chatting with my parents about some random topic and my mom compared my younger cousin to her elder sister saying “why can’t she do it, did her sister not do it?” (this has a huge back story though) to which my dad replied, “NO! what if her sister did it?, twins who are born at the same time also don’t have the same destiny, then how can you compare with someone who is 5 years elder to her?” Which actually made me realise, that everyone has their own pace and we should accept the fact and trust the process, maybe one is an early bloomer or a late bloomer; but the “early” and “late” is not relevant , if one doesn’t forget to “BLOOM”
