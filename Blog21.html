                        <h3>By Mythili Menon</h3>
                        <h3>August 4, 2020</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                            I am pretty sure most of us have had relationship issues. We all have had our share of troubled connections, we really didn’t want them to end , but we had to so that we could eventually move on . I’ll be honest, during the initial years of my teenage, I believed in loving only a person till death. I’ll fall madly and deeply in love with one person , date him and then have a happily ever after .
                        <p><br>
                            But as I am in the last year of teenage, I have realised that the idea of love, relationships and commitment have truly changed for me . For me , I always thought that love is like a permanent thing . It’s like the anchor for the ship called life . And there we find our soulmate and embark on a journey together. This is what I felt in the tender age of 13 /14 . And now , at the age of 19 , all I want is someone to hold on to and also accepting the fact that when things get rough , you need to let go . The art of letting go is something I wouldn’t be able to master, ever. I know, that when things start getting toxic , you need to cut them off. But who guarantees that with letting go a person, the memories wouldn’t haunt , you wouldn’t have to have nights cradling yourself to sleep while you would either ball your eyes out on the pillow or have a heavy chest with a damaged heart which may or may not be the same after some time. The fear of letting someone go has always put me in rather toxic relations and often I have sacrificed my self esteem and dignity over people who don’t deserve an iota of effort and love or genuine affection.

                        <p>
                            Love can dramatically change a person and I don’t wanna lie I have seen people change all of a sudden. The ones who used to smile wholeheartedly and carefree , now often smile rarely . I wouldn’t deny the fact that love isn’t beautiful, it definitely is , but what ruins the essence of this emotion is people , their emotional baggage and what kind of impact they leave on people around them. We often need to check how toxic we ourselves have been indirectly and how many times have we changed the definition of love for others unintentionally . Look deep inside your soul and recognize the energy you emit . Cause you don’t know how someone might be finding it difficult to let you go too.//
