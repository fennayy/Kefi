                            A couple of nights ago, I was asked to write a blog for Kefi and I quickly jumped at the opportunity of trying something new during this time where we don't have much to look up to. Soon enough I found myself thinking about what do I consider "happy"? what do I consider "light-hearted"?   
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            The first thing that popped in my head was this one year old chef Kobe who goes by the name of kobe_yn on Instagram, he is an adorable little chef cooking up literal joy with his patient mom. (I highly recommend watching him in times of sadness!) Another thing that came up when I heard the name "Kefi" was how it sounded happy, just like a morning cup of coffee!  
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Since we've had so much time on our hands these days, I have religiously been watching my favourite YouTubers called The Try Guys and listening to their Podcasts. (Again, I highly recommend!) 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            But aside from content, I have truly enjoyed getting back in touch with my art that I stopped focusing on years ago. I've found myself to be very amused by the work I was able to create that I'd never attempted before because I was too critical about my own work. It's very hard for me to be truly appreciative of my art but it's the process of keeping my hands busy rather than my mind that gives me comfort. Something I realised later was that keeping my hands busy has actually helped in keeping my thoughts in check and in keeping the unnecessary ones at bay.   
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            As much as I have missed going out, I have also enjoyed being able to draw again, being able to sit near the window for hours again, being able to spend days doing nothing, being able to stay at home dry and comfortable instead of in locals during the very uncomfortable monsoons of Mumbai. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Nobody anticipated the lives that we have right now, and amidst all the challenges with our mental health and our situations one thing I keep reminding myself of is that <strong> all will be as it should be.</strong>
